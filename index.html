        <p>My name is Anand Chaudhary. I was born in Nepal in the year 1990. I Went to South India for my higher
            education when I was 11 back in the year 2001. I moved to the United States when I was 19 years of age, in
            the year 2010. I was still pursuing my bachelors degree when I got the opportunity to come to the US. I
            decided to complete my degree and I did so in the year 2012 and secured my Bachelors of Business
            Administration from the prestigious 178 years old college with rich curriculum, culture and diversity called
            the Madras Christian College. </p> 
        <p>One thing I really love about myself is my passion for learning new things. I think without this curiosity I
            would just be an empty shell of a person, just hollow on the inside. I have never stopped learning and will
            continue to do so till the end of my life. I love to play music, dance and sing, cook delicious food, being
            on my laptop, outdoor sports, travelling, photography, creating arts and be in the midst of nature whenever
            time permits.
        </p> 
        <p>In my professional life I have worn several hats from being a school teacher to a sales person, a businessman
            to sales support for optical cabling manufacturing and right now for the past couple of years, I’ve been
            slowly and steadily progressing into the world of computers computer science. I started coding in the early
            2017 and started with the Business Analyst training by developing my understanding of SDLC of a software and
            the processes involved in it right from the project initiation to the deployment phase as well as various
            methodologies involved in the different stages of the product life cycle. Right now, I’m undertaking the
            full-stack web-development course from the School of Professional Studies at Northwestern University and
            will be graduating in November of 2019.
        </p>
